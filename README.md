# Parallel Uncertainty-aware Multiobjective Planning

This repo contains the code for "Real-Time Stochastic Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Multiobjective Search on GPUs," which presents the parallel uncertainty-aware multiobjective planning algorithm submitted to WAFR '16 for solving the stochastic kinodynamic motion planning problem.

Will clone from my private repo shortly.
